<h1>CARP</h1>
<section class="container-typo-one">
    <div class="type-container">
        <p class="push-three"> I chose the image i did for this project as i likes the simplicity of the background combined with the image of the lady doing a trick. I also liked the ramp in the background to add a more skatepark feel to my poster. I incorported contrast in many ways, starting with the colour theme. I chose the colour blue as it matched the skate ramp aswell as my website. This meant that there is an array of blues all over the page. Additionally, i also used a contrast in different stroke sizes on the letters to create emphasis on words "ages" and "abilities". To Align my words, I also made use of different typographic systems such as radial, axial and grid. I enhanced the timings of the clinic by alining the words in a radial format around the skaters head along with the dates, as they go hand in hand. To make use of the larger space i used a axial typographic system for the title where each word of the title is slighted slightly on an axis. The rest of the lines are mostly in a Grid like fashion. This is becuase it breaks up the information nicely and easy to read. Regarding repetition, although there is a contrast in blues and strok. There is a clear repetitive theme througout. The dark blue matches the skate jump in the background and that colour is repetead throughout in font and stroke colours. The strokes are also made thicker to enhance words and letter which again is repetead througout the poster. There is also repition of the the typographic systems used, including Radial and Grid. The radial information around her head and hip is used as repition aswell as contrast as they are on oppsite sides. In the title i incorporated repetition of the first letter with a higher stroke. The proximity in my poster is pretty basic. With regards to hierachy, the most important peices of information are larger or in a bolder font.</p>
