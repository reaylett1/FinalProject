<h1>Reflection</h1>

<p class="description">
    The task was to code our own website, publish it onto GitHub including our typography, CARP and weekly coding websites.</p>

   <p>At first, I found the weekly coding sheets difficult however each time I completed one, I got faster as the concepts start to make sense due to the repetition and being able to see what happens when you refresh your page. One I completed all the websites I used what I had learnt from the coding worksheets and incorporated it into my own. One of the things I learnt from the coding worksheets that helped me was choosing your colour palette beforehand. This helped keep a structure throughout my website. In addition to this I also found new fonts such as the bubble font I used for my main headers. These all helped to elevate my website. Another main concept that I took from the coding worksheets were the buttons. I incorporated this heavily in my website as the main navigation system, to get to each page. I like how it turned out however, I think that the spacing is a bit off and I would have liked to add images on the buttons as a preview as to what you were clicking on.</p>

    <p>For the typographic system project, I decided to break up the blue theme with a splash of pink. I think this goes well to add a little bit of contrast with the main design. I think I executed some like Axial accurately however, I think that my random system could have been improved with more random sequences and being a bit more illegible. I found it hard to get to grips with Adobe illustrator at first however the more I used it the more I got used it. This then helped me get to grips with In Design for when I wanted to do my CARP project. Overall I was happy with my CARP project however I would have liked to incorporated some different shapes to add a modular typographic system. Additionally I would have liked to have used a different array of fonts that were a bit more obscure to add interest to my poster. I was happy with the contrast of colours and strokes as they added a modern feel to my poster.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, I think that I executed my projects to the brief however, more attention to the finer detail could have been made to improve it further such as creating and image for the cover of the buttons.</p>
